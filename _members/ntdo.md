From 2017 to now, I am working in the Pattern Recognition Lab, Department of Artificial Intelligence Convergence, Chonnam National University, Korea. I received the B.S. degree in information system major from HCMC University of Foreign Language – Information Technology, Vietnam, in 2005, the M.S. degree in Information System Management from International University, Vietnam National University at HCMC, Viet Nam, in 2017, and the Ph.D. degree in Artificial Intelligence Convergence, Chonnam National University, South Korea, in 2021. From 2005 to 2017, I was a lecturer in the Faculty of Information Technology, HCM University of Foreign Languages and Information Technology, Vietnam. My research interests are pattern recognition, deep learning, computer vision, and parallel programming.
