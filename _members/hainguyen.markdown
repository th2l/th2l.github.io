I received the B.S. degree from the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Ho Chi Minh City University of Science (VNUHCM), Vietnam, in 2018. I joined the PR lab in March 2021. I am currently working toward the M.S. degree from the Department of Artificial Intelligence Convergence, Chonnam National University, South Korea. My research interests include pattern recognition and sentiment analysis.
