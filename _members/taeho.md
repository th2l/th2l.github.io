I received the B.S. degree from the Department of Physics, Chonnam National University (JNU), South Korea in 2021 and joined the PR lab in the same year. I am currently working toward the M.S. degree from the Graduate school of Information Security, Chonnam National University, South Korea. My research interests include physical security and pattern recognition.
